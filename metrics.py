    Calculate batch entropy mixing score
    
    Algorithm
    -----
        * 1. Calculate the regional mixing entropies at the location of 100 randomly chosen cells from all batches
        * 2. Define 100 nearest neighbors for each randomly chosen cell
        * 3. Calculate the mean mixing entropy as the mean of the regional entropies
        * 4. Repeat above procedure for 100 iterations with different randomly chosen cells.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        np.array of shape nsamples x nfeatures.
    batches
        batch labels of nsamples.
    n_neighbors
        The number of nearest neighbors for each randomly chosen cell. By default, n_neighbors=100.
    n_samples_per_pool
        The number of randomly chosen cells from all batches per iteration. By default, n_samples_per_pool=100.
    n_pools
        The number of iterations with different randomly chosen cells. By default, n_pools=100.
        
    Returns
